  <meta name="description" content="ABOUT RUNWAY

Runway is a collaborative business planning platform designed to make business intuitively understandable for everyone.

Our Mission: To make business accessible and understandable to everyone. We believe that teams that understand the “why” behind their work are more productive and make better decisions. True alignment and collaboration come from having a shared source of truth that everyone understands.

Our Approach: Runway replaces traditional spreadsheets with a modern planning platform that brings clarity and context to business operations for all teams — not just finance. Just as Figma made design accessible across the organization, Runway does the same for business planning.

Why It Matters: Understanding requires more than just access to numbers; real collaboration happens when teams see how their work fits into the bigger picture. By providing this context, Runway helps teams save time and move faster.

Our Customers: World-class companies like AngelList, Superhuman, Stability.AI, ConvertKit, Lambda Labs, Lob, and SandboxVR rely on Runway to run their businesses more efficiently.

Our Investors: We are supported by a select group of investors that we admire, including Garry Tan (YC &amp; Initialized), a16z, Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Dylan Field (founder of Figma), Eric Ries, Claire Hughes Johnson (COO of Stripe), Henry Ward (founder of Carta), Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Eugene Wei, Lenny Rachitsky, Nikita Bier, Scott Belsky, Soleio Cuervo, Balaji Srinivasan, and many others.


WORKING AT RUNWAY

We&#39;re early, so you&#39;ll have an opportunity to shape not just our product, but the company itself: who we work with, and how we work together.

We strive to be clear in our communication and over-communicate by default.

We&#39;re remote-first, so you can work from anywhere in North America. However, we also believe in the value of face-time to solve really hard problems, so we:

 - Meet together as a company every quarter in our San Francisco office.

 - Open up offices in places with many teammates (we currently have offices in SF and NYC).

 - Make it easy to fly out and meet together.

Below are the values we share as a team, so if you like these, you may enjoy working here.


OUR VALUES

 - 💩 Give a Shit: Giving a shit can’t be taught. It’s an inner drive that compels you to do what’s right and do it well. Have passion, take pride, and care deeply about your impact.

 - 💡 Create Clarity: Cut through ambiguity and reveal the truth. Start with why, then answer how and what. Treat problems like puzzles, dig deeper, and find the right path.

 - 🤝 Build Trust: With trust, it’s safe to take risks. We get there by being open, honest, and accountable. Actively listen, speak your mind, and consistently show up.

 - ✨ Raise the Bar: Scrap the status quo and push yourself to create something that wows. Get others excited to do the same. Iterate, elevate, and don’t stop moving forward.



JOB DESCRIPTION

The Account Executive, as an early sales employee, is responsible for supercharging Runway’s growth.

Customers and evangelists will delight in the go-to-market motions that you build with resourcefulness and ingenuity and the organization will be better for the customer insights that you will deliver. You will work directly with leadership and product to build, shape, and iterate in a way that sets up the organization for long term success. And, your work today will directly impact and serve as the foundation for the high-growth strategies that we build for years to come.


WHAT YOU’LL DO

 - Build processes and leverage data to build a credible, scalable selling motion that can be easily communicated with the broader organization

 - Leverage a creative and empathetic communication style to build an exemplary sales process that is differentiated in branding and positioning

 - Run point on all aspects of deal execution, from evaluating and assessing the strategic and economic impact of potential opportunities to deal structuring and negotiating

 - Develop and nurture key relationships with our partners and within the broader ecosystem, while orchestrating the right executive touch points

 - Ensure the success of the sales team is built alongside the success of Customer Success, Marketing, Design, and Product teams in ways that expedite Runway’s ability to learn, iterate, and deliver an excellent experience to each prospect and customer


WE’D LOVE TO HEAR FROM IF YOU HAVE…

 - Success at building and scaling a high volume, fast-paced technical sales cycle. Ideally this includes 4+ years of experience successfully selling software

 - Experience going from $0 to $10M in ARR, and comfortable running point on multiple different types of customer engagements

 - Ability to build territories, set and meet targets, and multitask with excellent organizational skills

 - Comfort in fast paced environments, flourish with minimal guidance, and handle uncertainty and ambiguity

---------------------------------------

The OTE range for this full-time position is $180,000-$260,000 + generous early employee equity + benefits. The salary component ranges from $102,000-$154,000. The range displayed in this job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire OTE for this position. Within the range, individual pay is determined by various factors, including job-related skills (as uncovered during the interview process), experience, and relevant education or training. Please note that the compensation details listed in this posting reflect total on-target-earnings, and do not include equity or benefits." />
