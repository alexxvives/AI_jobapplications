Compensation Overview
At Strava, we know our employees are the most important ingredient to our success, and our compensation and total rewards programs reflect that. We take a market-based approach to pay, and pay may vary depending on the department and your location. Salary ranges are categorized into one of three tiers based on a cost of labor index for that geographic area. We will determine the candidate’s starting pay based on job-related skills, experience, qualifications, work location, and market conditions. We may modify these ranges in the future. For more information, please contact your talent partner.
Compensation: The base salary range for this role is $129,00 - $137,000. However, because this role is eligible for a target bonus of 30%, it is common for employees in this role to receive on-target earnings of $167,000- $178,000. This range reflects base compensation only and does not include equity or benefits. Your recruiter can share more details about the full compensation package, including the range specific to your location, during the hiring process.
