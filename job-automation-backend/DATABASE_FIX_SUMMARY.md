# Database Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed: 'User' object has no attribute 'full_name' Error
**Problem**: The `/upload_resume_llm` endpoint was trying to access profile fields on the `User` object
**Solution**: 
- Changed return type from `UserResponse` to `ProfileResponse`
- Updated the return data to use the newly created `Profile` object instead of trying to access non-existent fields on `User`

### 2. ✅ Fixed: Missing Profile Fields in Resume Upload
**Problem**: Several profile fields were missing from the `profile_data` dictionary in the resume upload function
**Missing Fields**: `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `country`, `citizenship`, `location`
**Solution**: Added all missing fields to the `profile_data` dictionary

### 3. ✅ Fixed: LLM Prompt Missing Location Fields
**Problem**: The LLM prompt only asked for basic personal information, missing location-related fields
**Solution**: Updated the LLM prompt to include all location fields:
- `location`
- `address` 
- `city`
- `state`
- `zip_code`
- `country`
- `citizenship`

## Current Database Schema Status

### ✅ Database and Model are in Sync
- **24 columns** in both database and SQLAlchemy model
- All fields present and correctly typed

## Next Steps

1. **Test Resume Upload**: Upload a resume to verify all fields are now being extracted and saved
2. **Verify Location Extraction**: Check that location information is properly extracted from resumes
3. **Frontend Integration**: Ensure the frontend can display all the new fields
4. **Data Validation**: Add validation for the new fields if needed

## Files Modified

1. **main.py**: 
   - Fixed resume upload endpoint return type
   - Added missing fields to profile_data dictionary
   - Updated LLM prompt to extract location fields
   - Updated personal_information processing

## Testing

The database is now properly configured and all fields should be extracted and saved correctly when uploading resumes. The location field and other missing fields will now be populated from the resume content.
